# Hospital-Clinical-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a genuine electronic clinical dataset from real medical facilities, providing valuable insights into cancer patient outcomes. The analysis demonstrates the application of SQL and data science techniques to authentic healthcare data.

## Dataset

Source: Kaggle Clinical Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/clinical-dataset/)

Type: Real electronic clinical data from medical facilities

Unique Identifier: DOI (Dataset Object Identifier)

Last Updated: 2023

Author: Haoyang Mi

Citation: Used in 333 scholarly articles

The dataset comprises two cohorts:

1. Discovery Cohort
2. Validation Cohort

Includes information on patient demographics, survival time, tumor characteristics, genetic mutations, and treatment details.
## Objectives

- Demonstrate SQL-driven analysis of real electronic clinical data.
- Compare cancer stage distributions between Validation and Discovery Cohorts.
- Analyze the relationship between tumor size and survival time.
- Evaluate the impact of EGFR and KRAS mutations on survival outcomes.
- Assess the influence of smoking history on survival times.
- Identify potential prognostic factors for future clinical research.

## Tools Used

- SQL: Primary tool for querying and analyzing the clinical data
- Python: For data manipulation and advanced statistical analysis
- Pandas: Data manipulation library
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization libraries
- SQLite: Database for storing and querying the clinical data
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for analysis and visualization

## Rationale

- SQL is heavily used in healthcare for managing and analyzing clinical databases
- Python provides additional analytical capabilities for complex statistical analyses
- Combining SQL and Python allows for comprehensive exploration of the clinical data
